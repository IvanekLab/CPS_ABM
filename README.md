**Study: Using Agent-Based Modeling to compare corrective actions for _Listeria_ contamination in produce packinghouses**

In this study, two Agent-Based Models of raw produce packinghouses were developed as a way to simulate dynamics of _Listeria_ in the built environment by modeling the different surfaces of equipment and employees in a facility as agents, as well as evaluation of various corrective actions. The components of the model developed in NetLogo and R codes used to analyze the model outputs can be found in the following folders:
* Facility_A_Corrective_Actions (files used to build an agent-based model of Facility A in Netlogo and analyse it in R)
* Facility_B_Corrective_Actions (files used to build an agent-based model of Facility B in Netlogo and analyse it in R)
* Figures (files used to take data from both Facility A and B and create figures in R)

_Note: large results data was zipped to be uploaded to this repo, each model's BehaviorSpace folder (i.e., Facility_A_Corrective_Actions/Analysis/Facility_A_Corrective_Actions/Data/BehaviorSpace and Facility_B_Corrective_Actions/Analysis/Facility_B_Corrective_Actions/Data/BehaviorSpace) contains .zip files that contain additional .csv files. These must be extracted to the BehaviorSpace folder (i.e., "Extract Here") for analysis in R_
